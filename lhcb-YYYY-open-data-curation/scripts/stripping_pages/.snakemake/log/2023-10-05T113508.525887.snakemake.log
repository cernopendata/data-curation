Removing output files of failed job list_raw_stripping since they might be corrupted:
/Users/mindaugassarpis/Work/OpenData/release/stripping_pages/raw/lists/lines_list_stripping21r0p1_radiative.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
