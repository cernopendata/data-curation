NanoAODRun1:
  recid_start: 40000
  title: <dataset> dataset in Run1 NanoAOD-like format
  abstract:
    description: >
      <p><dataset> dataset in a NanoAOD-like research-level Ntuple format for CMS Run1 data, readable with bare
      <a href="https://root.cern/">ROOT</a> or other ROOT-compatible software, and containing the per-event information that is needed in most generic analyses. 
      In contrast to the CMS NanoAOD format which is derived from MiniAOD, it is generated directly from the AOD format with completely 
      independent code provided by the CMS open data group. Nevertheless, there is a large overlap in functionality and content between 
      NanoAODRun1 and NanoAOD such that common analyses are possible.</p>
      <p>The dataset is provided as a collection of root files and in <dataset>_merged.root with the separate files merged into one file. 
      This dataset was processsed from the primary dataset in AOD format linked below.</p>

POET:
  recid_start: 50000
  title: <dataset> dataset in reduced NanoAOD-like format
  abstract:
    description: >
      <p>This dataset contains information extracted from different physics objects from the 2015 MiniAOD parent <parent_dataset> dataset, 
      readable with bare <a href="https://root.cern/">ROOT</a> or other ROOT-compatible software. It was produced for the CMS open data workshop tutorials.</p>
      <p>It is provided in two different structures: a collection of root files as a direct output of POET 
      (separate trees for each object), and "_flat.root" files "flattened" to a single tree, as required when used as input to coffea with 
      nanoevents schema.  <dataset>_flat.root has the separate "_flat.root" files merged into one file. 
      This dataset was derived from the primary dataset in MiniAOD format linked below.</p>
